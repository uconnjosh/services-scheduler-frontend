Based on classical Hatha Yoga, but flipped upside down and all around, AIReal classes are a perfect integration of tradition and innovation. You will progress through a spectrum of postures, using the hammock as a prop for balance, and as a spotting device to safely guide you into postures you might have thought impossible to access. As you elevate your practice, the hammock will allow you to deepen stretches, lengthen and strengthen the entire body, and access a deeper state of relaxation. As you flow and fly freely in the body, you will free up the breath and slide into a stress-free state-of-mind. Bring on the mind, body, breath connection Wanderlusters!",
